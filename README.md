Hi guys,

I am currently learning Visual Basic 2019.

I enjoy programming, but still have so much to learn. I have many books on the subject from VB6 to the current version. These are a great resource, as is the internet!

I also know a little ASP 3.0, but now looking into learning ASP.net. I have a good knowledge of HTML5. SQL & Access VBA.
